	MSCeditor 1.11 - a savefile editor			by durkhaz
	For the (great) game "My Summer Car"		by Amistech Games 
<###########################################>

Q: What does it do?
A: It converts binary data to human readable form and back, allowing you to edit your savefiles as you please!
It currently supports the following datatypes: FLOAT, BOOL, ARRAY, INT, STRING, VECTOR3, VECTOR4.  

Q: Where do I find my savefiles?
A: AppData\LocalLow\Amistech\My Summer Car\. The tool should open the correct folder on first launch though.

Q: There's 6 files, which one do I open?
A: The entries of interest are inside "defaultES2File". But you could open the other ones too.

Q: I changed some values and now the game won't load my savefile. Is this a bug?
A: No, I tried my best to validate all the data, but there's only so much I can do. If you want to break the game, there's always a way.

Q: Why do entries show up red?
A: red = unsaved modified entries. Right click to reset them to their file state

Q: How do backups work?
A: When the option is enabled, it saves backups to the same folder the savefiles are in.  It will make a backup everytime you save, so no data can be lost!

Q: This is neat, how do I support you?
A: Feedback and bug reports would be nice :)  There's a button in the "about" dialog that takes you directly to the steam community thread.
